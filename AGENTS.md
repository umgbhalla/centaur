# Centaur — Developer Guide

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone and configure

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd centaur
cp .env.example .env
```

Centaur needs a small set of secrets to boot. You have two options:

**Option A: Environment variables (simplest, good for dev)**

Set `SECRET_MANAGER_BACKEND=env` in `.env`, then provide secrets directly:

```bash
SECRET_MANAGER_BACKEND=env

# Postgres (auto-created by docker compose)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://tempo:tempo_dev@pgbouncer:5432/centaur

# Slack app (from https://api.slack.com/apps)
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-...
SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET=...

# At least one LLM key (for the agent harness)
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
```

**Option B: 1Password (recommended for production)**

Set `OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN` and `OP_VAULT`, then store the same secrets as items in your 1Password vault. The secrets manager sidecar loads them automatically.

### 2. Boot the stack

```bash
docker compose up -d
docker compose build sandbox
```

### 3. Test

From inside the API container (localhost bypass — no key needed):

```bash
THREAD_KEY=test-e2e-1

SPAWN=$(docker exec centaur-api-1 curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/agent/spawn \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"thread_key\":\"${THREAD_KEY}\",\"harness\":\"amp\"}")
ASSIGNMENT_GENERATION=$(printf '%s' "$SPAWN" | jq -r '.assignment_generation')

docker exec centaur-api-1 curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/agent/message \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"thread_key\":\"${THREAD_KEY}\",\"assignment_generation\":${ASSIGNMENT_GENERATION},\"role\":\"user\",\"parts\":[{\"type\":\"text\",\"text\":\"Reply with exactly PONG and nothing else.\"}]}"

EXECUTE=$(docker exec centaur-api-1 curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/agent/execute \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"thread_key\":\"${THREAD_KEY}\",\"assignment_generation\":${ASSIGNMENT_GENERATION},\"harness\":\"amp\",\"delivery\":{\"platform\":\"dev\"}}")
EXECUTION_ID=$(printf '%s' "$EXECUTE" | jq -r '.execution_id')

docker exec centaur-api-1 curl -s "http://localhost:8000/agent/executions/${EXECUTION_ID}" | jq
```

Or create a DB-backed key for external use (see [API Key Management](#api-key-management)).

## Architecture

See the [architecture diagram in the README](README.md#architecture).

### End-to-End Request Flow

1. User mentions bot in Slack → webhook → slackbot → api
2. API spawns/reuses Docker container (`centaur-agent:latest`) for that thread
3. Executes harness (amp/claude-code/codex) via `docker exec`
4. Harness calls tools via `curl` back to API at `http://api:8000` (REST, NOT MCP)
5. LLM API calls route through firewall proxy which injects real credentials
6. Results stream as JSON events → posted to Slack

### Service Interface Contracts

Centaur is a modular service architecture. Each service communicates through well-defined interfaces. As long as you implement these interfaces, you can swap or extend any layer independently.

**Client → API** (durable control-plane protocol):

Clients (slackbot, CLI, external integrations) should stay thin. They persist input with `spawn -> message -> execute`, stream or replay output from the durable events endpoint, and only fall back to durable terminal state when the live stream is gone. The API owns runtime assignment, execution serialization, cancellation, and final-delivery recovery; Postgres is the source of truth.

**Step 1: Assign or reuse a runtime** (`POST /agent/spawn`)

Pins one warm runtime to the thread and returns the current `assignment_generation`.

```
POST /agent/spawn
{
  "thread_key": "slack:C0AJ07U8Z1N:1773364194.179929",
  "harness": "amp"
}

← {
    "thread_key": "slack:C0AJ07U8Z1N:1773364194.179929",
    "runtime_id": "rtm_123",
    "assignment_generation": 12,
    "state": "assigned_idle"
  }
```

**Step 2: Persist the user turn** (`POST /agent/message`)

Writes one durable transcript event. Inline base64 image/document blocks are extracted into `attachments` and rewritten to lightweight `attachment_ref` parts.

```
POST /agent/message
{
  "thread_key": "slack:C0AJ07U8Z1N:1773364194.179929",
  "assignment_generation": 12,
  "role": "user",
  "parts": [{"type": "text", "text": "analyze this"}],
  "user_id": "U123",
  "metadata": {"user_name": "alice", "platform": "slack"}
}

← {"ok": true, "message_id": "msg_123"}
```

**Step 3: Enqueue execution** (`POST /agent/execute`)

Creates a durable execution request plus final-delivery obligation. The worker drives the attached container; the response is just the execution handle.

```
POST /agent/execute
{
  "thread_key": "slack:C0AJ07U8Z1N:1773364194.179929",
  "assignment_generation": 12,
  "harness": "amp",
  "delivery": {"platform": "slack"}
}

← {"ok": true, "execution_id": "exe_123", "status": "queued"}
```

**Step 4: Stream or replay output** (`GET /agent/threads/{thread_key}/events`)

Consumers tail durable events for one execution. On disconnect, reconnect with the last seen event id. If the execution already finished and no more rows remain, the API emits the terminal `execution_state` snapshot.

```
GET /agent/threads/slack:C0AJ07U8Z1N:1773364194.179929/events?execution_id=exe_123&after_event_id=0

← SSE event: amp_raw_event
← data: {"type":"assistant","message":{...}}
← SSE event: turn.done
← data: {"type":"turn.done","result":"..."}
← SSE event: execution_state
← data: {"status":"completed","result_text":"..."}
```

**Step 5: Release only when you really want to end the assignment** (`POST /agent/threads/{thread_key}/release`)

Releases the thread-to-runtime pin and optionally cancels any non-terminal execution still tied to that assignment generation.

**Durable state written for one turn:**

| Table | What |
|-------|------|
| `agent_runtime_assignments` | Thread-to-runtime pin and active assignment generation |
| `agent_message_requests` | Durable inbound transcript events |
| `attachments` | Extracted attachment bytes for inline multimodal content |
| `agent_execution_requests` | Queued/running/terminal execution row |
| `agent_execution_events` | Replayable raw + projected execution events |
| `agent_final_delivery_outbox` | Final-result delivery obligation for reconnect/retry paths |

`POST /agent/connect` and `POST /agent/reconnect` are legacy endpoints now kept only as explicit `410 LEGACY_ENDPOINT_REMOVED` stubs. Do not build new clients on them.

**API → Sandbox** (Docker stdin/stdout, NDJSON):

The API communicates with sandbox containers over Docker attach sockets. The wire format is **Anthropic message format** — this is the canonical protocol between the API and all sandboxes, regardless of which harness runs inside.

```
→ stdin:  {"type":"turn.start","turn_id":1,"text":"analyze this"}
→ stdin:  {"type":"turn.start","turn_id":2,"content":[             // Anthropic content blocks
             {"type":"text","text":"what is this?"},
             {"type":"image","source":{"type":"base64","media_type":"image/png","data":"..."}}
           ]}
→ stdin:  {"type":"interrupt"}

← stdout: {"type":"system","subtype":"init","session_id":"T-..."}
← stdout: {"type":"assistant","message":{"role":"assistant","content":[...]}}
← stdout: {"type":"result","subtype":"success","result":"..."}
← stdout: {"type":"turn.done","turn_id":1,"result":"..."}
```

**Sandbox harness adapter** (`services/sandbox/harness_session.py`):

The sandbox's `harness_session.py` translates the standard Anthropic format into whatever each harness CLI actually accepts:

| Harness | Translation |
|---------|-------------|
| **claude-code** | Pass through directly (native Anthropic format) |
| **amp** | Materialize image/document blocks to files on disk, replace with `@/path` text mentions (Amp stdin only accepts text blocks) |
| **codex / pi-mono** | Extract text from content blocks, pass as CLI argument |

This means clients and the API never need to know about harness-specific quirks. They speak Anthropic format; the sandbox adapter handles the rest.

**Sandbox → API** (REST over Docker network):

Agents call tools via `curl http://api:8000/tools/<tool>/<method>` over the `agent_net` Docker network. Auth is via `CENTAUR_API_KEY` injected at container creation.

### Network Isolation

| Network | Scope | Services |
|---------|-------|----------|
| `secrets_net` | internal | firewall → secrets |
| `secrets_egress` | external | secrets → 1Password SDK |
| `default` | internal | slackbot ↔ api ↔ monitoring-facing services |
| `agent_net` | internal | sandbox containers ↔ firewall ↔ api |
| `agent_egress` | external | sandbox direct egress for Amp DTW |
| `control_net` | internal | api ↔ pgbouncer ↔ firewall |
| `backend_net` | internal | postgres, pgbouncer, api, slackbot |
| `obs_net` | internal | victoriametrics, victorialogs, fluentbit, grafana |

## Debugging

**Always check logs first.** When debugging any issue with the deployed stack (agent misbehavior, tool failures, request errors), your first step should be querying VictoriaLogs on the deploy box — not guessing, reading source code, or theorizing. Logs tell you what actually happened.

```bash
# Look up logs for a specific Slack thread
ssh ubuntu@206.223.235.69 "docker exec centaur-api-1 curl -s 'http://victorialogs:9428/select/logsql/query' \
  --data-urlencode 'query=thread_key:<THREAD_KEY>' --data-urlencode 'limit=50'"

# API errors in the last hour
ssh ubuntu@206.223.235.69 "docker exec centaur-api-1 curl -s 'http://victorialogs:9428/select/logsql/query' \
  --data-urlencode 'query=_stream:{service=\"api\"} AND level:error' --data-urlencode 'limit=20'"

# Sandbox container logs (agent harness output)
ssh ubuntu@206.223.235.69 "docker logs <container_id> 2>&1 | tail -100"
```

Only after reviewing logs should you dig into source code or try to reproduce locally.

## Terminology

- **Chat SDK** always refers to the [Vercel Chat SDK](https://github.com/vercel/chat) (`~/github/vercel/chat`). When you need to understand how the Chat SDK or `@chat-adapter/*` packages work, **always read the source at `~/github/vercel/chat`** — never dig through `node_modules`.

## Testing Before Pushing

**NEVER push changes without testing them locally first.** Testing means actually running the affected service and proving the change works end-to-end — not just linting or reasoning about it.

1. **Build the affected service:** `docker compose build <service>`
2. **Bring it up:** `docker compose up -d <service>`
3. **Make a real request** that exercises the change and show the output
4. **Only then** commit and push

For tool changes: tools hot-reload, so just verify via `curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/tools/<tool>/<method>` from inside the API container. For Dockerfile/infra changes: rebuild, restart, and verify the binary/service is present and functional. For firewall changes: test from inside a sandbox container through the proxy.

## Local-First Testing — Never Touch the Deploy Box

**All testing and E2E validation MUST happen on the local stack** (`docker compose up` on this machine). Never SSH into the deploy box (`206.223.235.69`) to run tests, rebuild services, or make ad-hoc changes unless explicitly told to do so by the user.

The deploy box is **production**. Changes reach it via `git push` → GitHub Actions auto-deploy. The only reasons to SSH into it are:
- Checking logs (`docker logs`, VictoriaLogs queries) for debugging production issues
- Emergency manual intervention — **only when the user explicitly asks**

For E2E testing, always:
1. `docker compose build <service>` locally
2. `docker compose up -d <service>` locally
3. Run curl commands against `localhost` (or `docker exec centaur-api-1 curl ...`)
4. Verify results locally
5. Only then commit, push, and let CI/CD handle production

## Code Conventions

- Python 3.11+, `uv` for deps, `ruff` for lint/format (line-length=100)
- `services/slackbot` uses `pnpm` only (single lockfile: `pnpm-lock.yaml`)
- All imports at top of file, never inside functions
- Absolute imports only: `from api.X`, `from centaur_sdk.X`
- All secrets via env vars or secret manager, never hardcode
- `asyncpg` for Postgres, `pgvector` for embeddings
- Conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `chore:`

## Lint & Test

Each service has its own `pyproject.toml` and `ruff.toml`. From the repo root:

```bash
uv run ruff check .          # lint
uv run ruff format .         # auto-fix
uv run pytest                # tests
```

## Plugin System — Tools & Workflows

Centaur has two plugin types that are auto-discovered at startup and hot-reloaded on file changes — no core code changes required to extend the system.

### Tool Plugins

Tools live in directories listed in `tools.toml` (`plugin_dirs`). Each tool is a directory with `client.py` (class + `_client()` factory), `pyproject.toml`, and optional `cli.py`. The API auto-discovers tools on startup, generates REST endpoints at `/tools/{name}/{method}`, and hot-reloads on file changes.

- `client.py`: NO `load_dotenv()`. Secrets via `secret()` from `centaur_sdk.tool_sdk`.
- `cli.py`: YES `load_dotenv()` at top. Thin typer wrapper for standalone use.
- Methods starting with `_` are excluded from registration.
- Tool dependencies declared in `pyproject.toml` are installed at image build time.

Example:

```python
# tools/my-tool/client.py
import httpx

class MyToolClient:
    def search(self, query: str, limit: int = 10) -> dict:
        """Search for something."""
        resp = httpx.get(f"https://api.example.com/search?q={query}&limit={limit}")
        return resp.json()

def _client():
    return MyToolClient()
```

### Workflow Plugins

Workflows live in directories listed in the `WORKFLOW_DIRS` env var (colon-separated paths, bind-mounted into the API container). Each workflow is a single Python file exporting `WORKFLOW_NAME`, an async `handler(params, ctx)`, and an optional `Input` dataclass. See [Durable Workflows](#durable-workflows) for the full programming model.

Built-in workflows ship in `services/api/api/workflows/`. External workflows (like those in the top-level `workflows/` directory) are loaded identically — just point `WORKFLOW_DIRS` at them.

### Ordered Overlays

Centaur supports a first-class ordered overlay model, so organizations can extend the base repo without forking or relying on filesystem overlayfs. A common deployment keeps the base repo and an external overlay checkout side by side:

```
your-deployment/
├── centaur/              # This repo
└── centaur-overlay/      # Org-specific tools, workflows, skills, personas, prompt overlay
```

By default, the stock `docker-compose.yml` looks for an optional overlay at `~/centaur-overlay`, mounts it at `/app/overlay/org`, and includes its `tools/`, `workflows/`, `.agents/skills/`, persona prompts, and `services/sandbox/SYSTEM_PROMPT.md` after the base repo content.

Later overlay entries win cleanly when names collide, so the base repo stays generic while deployments can layer in org-specific behavior from outside the checkout.

## Durable Workflows

The workflow engine (`workflow_engine.py`) provides a checkpoint/replay model inspired by [Cloudflare Workflows](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workflows/). The handler function IS the workflow — steps are runtime-discovered via `ctx.step(name, fn)` calls. The engine checkpoints each step result to Postgres. On resume after crash or suspension, the handler re-executes top-to-bottom but skips steps that already have checkpoints (returning the cached result instantly). Dynamic branching, loops, and conditional logic work naturally because it is just Python.

### WorkflowContext API

Every handler receives `(params, ctx)` where `ctx: WorkflowContext` provides:

| Primitive | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `ctx.step(name, fn)` | Execute *fn* exactly once; return cached result on replay. Supports `retry` (RetryPolicy) and `timeout`. |
| `ctx.sleep(name, duration)` | Suspend the run for *duration*; checkpoint + resume automatically. |
| `ctx.sleep_until(name, when)` | Suspend until a specific datetime. |
| `ctx.wait_for_event(name, event_type, correlation_id)` | Suspend until an external event arrives via `POST /workflows/events`. |
| `ctx.start_workflow(name, workflow_name, run_input)` | Create a child workflow run (returns immediately). |
| `ctx.wait_for_workflow(name, run_id)` | Suspend until a child workflow reaches terminal state. |
| `ctx.run_workflow(name, workflow_name, run_input)` | Start + wait in one call. |
| `ctx.start_agent(name, text=…)` | Shorthand: start a child `agent_turn` workflow. |
| `ctx.run_agent(name, text=…)` | Shorthand: start + wait for a child `agent_turn` workflow. |
| `ctx.log(msg, **kwargs)` | Structured log, suppressed during replay. |

### Writing a workflow

```python
# workflows/my_workflow.py
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Any
from api.workflow_engine import WorkflowContext

WORKFLOW_NAME = "my_workflow"

@dataclass
class Input:
    message: str = "hello"

async def handler(inp: Input, ctx: WorkflowContext) -> dict[str, Any]:
    greeting = await ctx.step("gather", lambda: {"msg": inp.message})
    await ctx.sleep("pause", timedelta(minutes=5))
    result = await ctx.run_agent("agent", text=f"Summarize: {greeting['msg']}")
    return {"greeting": greeting, "agent_result": result}
```

### Workflow lifecycle

Runs go through: `queued → running → sleeping/waiting → running → … → completed/failed/cancelled`.

- **Worker pool**: `WORKFLOW_WORKER_CONCURRENCY` workers (default 2) poll for claimable runs.
- **Lease-based fencing**: Each worker holds a lease on its run, extended by a heartbeat. If the worker dies, the lease expires and another worker reclaims the run.
- **Schedules**: Cron-based or interval-based schedules are configured in `workflow_schedules` table and ticked by the worker loop.
- **External events**: `POST /workflows/events` delivers events that wake waiting runs.
- **Child workflows**: Parent→child relationships are tracked; cancelling a parent cascels linked executions.

### Workflow REST API

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `POST /workflows/runs` | Create a workflow run (`workflow_name`, `input`, optional `trigger_key` for idempotency, `eager_start`) |
| `GET /workflows/runs` | List runs (filter by `workflow_name`, `thread_key`, `status`, `parent_run_id`) |
| `GET /workflows/runs/{run_id}` | Get run details (status, checkpoints, waiting_on) |
| `GET /workflows/runs/{run_id}/children` | List child workflow runs |
| `GET /workflows/runs/{run_id}/checkpoints` | Inspect all checkpoints for a run |
| `POST /workflows/runs/{run_id}/cancel` | Cancel a run (idempotent for terminal runs) |
| `POST /workflows/events` | Deliver an external event (`event_type`, `correlation_id`, `payload`) |

### Built-in workflows

| Workflow | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `agent_turn` | Single durable agent turn: spawn → message → execute → wait for terminal result. |
| `slack_thread_turn` | Same as `agent_turn` but requires a Slack `thread_key`. Used by the slackbot. |
| `agent_loop` | Recurring agent loop: runs an agent turn every N seconds until the agent signals `{"done": true}`, max iterations, or deadline. |

### Durable state

| Table | What |
|-------|------|
| `workflow_runs` | Run metadata, status, input/output, parent/root hierarchy |
| `workflow_checkpoints` | Per-step cached results, linked execution/child-run IDs |
| `workflow_schedules` | Cron/interval schedule definitions with next_run_at tracking |
| `workflow_events` | External events for `wait_for_event` correlation |

## Agent Sandbox

### Overview

1 conversation = 1 Docker container. The API spawns containers running harness CLIs (amp, claude-code, codex). Inside the container, the harness calls back to the API via `curl` over REST.

### How the System Prompt Works

The sandbox image bakes `services/sandbox/SYSTEM_PROMPT.md` into `~/AGENTS.md` at build time. On container startup, `entrypoint.sh` copies it into the workspace root as `workspace/AGENTS.md` — this is the file that AI harnesses (Amp, Claude Code, Codex) read as their system instructions.

The system prompt tells the agent:
- **Identity**: it's running inside a Docker sandbox, calling back to the API for tool access
- **Tools**: three kinds — harness built-ins (Read, Bash, etc.), API tools via the `call` helper, and a headless browser
- **`call` helper** (`/usr/local/bin/call`): a bash wrapper around `curl` that provides a concise syntax for API tool calls. `call slack get_channel_history '{"channel":"general"}'` instead of a full curl command. Returns TOON format for token efficiency.
- **Slack messaging**: the agent's stdout IS the Slack reply — never call `send_message` on the active thread
- **Dashboard blocks**: fenced code blocks with `dashboard` language tag render structured tables, charts, and KPI cards in compatible Centaur clients
- **Rules**: never display secrets, show your work, lead with the answer

The `call` helper (`services/sandbox/call.sh`) handles routing:
- `call <tool> <method> [json]` → `POST /tools/<tool>/<method>`
- `call discover <tool>` → `GET /tools/<tool>`

Legacy `call search` / `call sql` shorthands were removed. Sandbox agents should call the concrete tool directly, for example `call websearch search '{"query":"..."}'` or another deployment-specific query method discovered via `call discover <tool>`.

### Persona System

The entrypoint supports persona overlays via `AGENT_PERSONA`. Persona prompts are discovered from the loaded tool directories (including overlays such as `~/centaur-overlay`) and appended after the base + org overlay system prompts at container startup.

### Container Config

- Joins `agent_net` Docker network → API reachable at `http://api:8000`
- Entrypoint injects `CENTAUR_API_URL` and `CENTAUR_API_KEY` env vars
- Stub API keys so harnesses init in API-key mode (not browser login)
- `HTTPS_PROXY=http://firewall:8080` routes LLM calls through the firewall
- Resource limits: 4GB memory, 2 CPUs
- Image tagged `centaur-agent:latest`
- Labels: `centaur-agent=true`, `ai2.thread`, `ai2.harness` for discovery/recovery

### Credential Injection (Firewall)

Sandbox containers never see real API keys. The firewall (`services/firewall/addon.py`) intercepts HTTPS and injects credentials from the secrets service:

| Target host | Header | Format |
|-------------|--------|--------|
| `api.anthropic.com` | `x-api-key` | raw |
| `api.openai.com` | `authorization` | bearer |
| `ampcode.com` | `authorization` | bearer |
| `api.github.com` | `authorization` | token |
| `github.com` | `authorization` | basic auth |

### Session Persistence

- **`sandbox_sessions`** table: tracks sandbox ID, harness, engine, state, thread key, and thread title
- **`chat_messages`** table: stores persisted user/assistant messages for Slackbot delivery and durable transcript surfaces
- On API restart, sandbox ownership is re-read from `sandbox_sessions`; process-local queues and sockets are rebuilt lazily per sandbox
- Containers are still discoverable via Docker labels even if DB state needs reconciliation

## Security Model

- **API auth**: All callers authenticate with DB-backed API keys (`aiv2_*` prefix, stored in `api_keys` table). Docker bridge IPs (localhost) bypass auth for container→API calls.
- **Sandbox auth**: Sandbox containers get auto-issued HMAC-signed tokens (`sbx1.*` prefix) minted by the API. These are short-lived (2h TTL) and scoped to `agent` + `tools:*`.
- **Slack**: HMAC-SHA256 signature verification on all webhooks
- **Public edge**: The default deployment exposes only `slackbot` on `127.0.0.1:8000` via the `nginx` edge service. Additional public routes are opt-in via `CENTAUR_NGINX_ENABLED_SERVICES`.
- **Sandbox isolation**: Containers get stub keys only; real keys injected by firewall proxy in-flight
- **Filesystem**: Host repos mounted read-only by default; only working repo is read-write
- **Docker socket**: Proxied via `tecnativa/docker-socket-proxy` — only container/network/exec ops allowed

## API Key Management

All API authentication uses **DB-backed keys** stored in the `api_keys` Postgres table. Keys are managed via the admin API (localhost-only, or requires `admin` scope).

### Getting a valid API key for testing

From the deploy box (localhost bypass):

```bash
# List all keys (shows name, prefix, scopes — never the key itself)
ssh ubuntu@206.223.235.69 "docker exec centaur-api-1 curl -s http://localhost:8000/admin/api-keys" | jq

# Create a new key
ssh ubuntu@206.223.235.69 "docker exec centaur-api-1 curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/admin/api-keys \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{\"name\": \"my-test-key\", \"scopes\": [\"*\"]}'" | jq

```

### Key types

| Type | Prefix | Issued by | Used by | Scopes |
|------|--------|-----------|---------|--------|
| DB keys | `aiv2_*` | Admin API | Slackbot, CLI, external callers | Per-key (e.g. `["*"]`, `["agent:execute"]`) |
| Sandbox tokens | `sbx1.*` | API (automatic) | Sandbox containers → API tool calls | `["agent", "tools:*"]` |

### How services get their keys

- **Slackbot**: `SLACKBOT_API_KEY` env var, bootstrapped from secrets service (1Password item name: `SLACKBOT_API_KEY`)
- **Sandbox containers**: Auto-issued `sbx1.*` token injected as `CENTAUR_API_KEY` at container creation
- **Local testing**: Use localhost bypass (no key needed from inside the API container), or create a key via admin API

## Secret Manager

The secrets service (`services/secrets/app.py`) loads all secrets from a 1Password vault on startup and refreshes periodically. Item titles are normalized to ENV_VAR style (e.g., "Claude API" → `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`).

For local development without 1Password, set `SECRET_MANAGER_BACKEND=env` and provide secrets directly in `.env`.

## Observability & Audit Logs

### Architecture

All services write structured JSON logs to **stdout**. Docker captures container logs. **Fluent Bit** discovers all Docker containers (including dynamically spawned agent sandboxes) and forwards logs to **VictoriaLogs**. **VictoriaMetrics** receives metrics via push from the API service. **Grafana** provides the query UI with provisioned VictoriaLogs and VictoriaMetrics datasources.

```
Service → stdout (JSON) → Docker log driver → Fluent Bit → VictoriaLogs → Grafana
```

This design means ephemeral sandbox containers are captured automatically — no per-container logging config needed.

### Components

| Component | Role | Config |
|-----------|------|--------|
| **VictoriaLogs** | Log storage + query engine | 7-day retention, `obs_net` |
| **VictoriaMetrics** | Metrics storage + query engine | Push-based, `obs_net` |
| **Grafana** | Dashboards + log explorer | VictoriaLogs datasource provisioned |
| **Fluent Bit** | Container log collector | `services/fluentbit/fluent-bit.conf` |

### Querying logs

Via Grafana: navigate to **Explore → VictoriaLogs** and use [LogsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/).

Via CLI (from inside the Docker network):

```bash
# All logs for a specific thread
docker exec centaur-api-1 curl -s "http://victorialogs:9428/select/logsql/query" \
  --data-urlencode "query=thread_key:C042WDDP89Y" --data-urlencode "limit=50"

# API errors in the last hour
docker exec centaur-api-1 curl -s "http://victorialogs:9428/select/logsql/query" \
  --data-urlencode "query=_stream:{service=\"api\"} AND level:error" --data-urlencode "limit=20"

# Firewall audit trail for a time range
docker exec centaur-api-1 curl -s "http://victorialogs:9428/select/logsql/query" \
  --data-urlencode "query=_stream:{service=\"firewall\"} AND event:proxy_audit" \
  --data-urlencode "start=2026-03-10T00:00:00Z" --data-urlencode "end=2026-03-11T00:00:00Z"
```

### Audit logging

The **firewall** emits a structured audit event for every outbound request from sandbox containers: method, host, path, status code, request/response bytes, duration, and source container IP. These are searchable via `event:proxy_audit` in VictoriaLogs.

The **API** logs tool calls (`event:tool_call_started`, `event:tool_call_completed`), session lifecycle (`event:warm_container_claimed`), and HTTP requests with thread context.

### Logging contract

Services must write single-line JSON to stdout with these fields:

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `timestamp` | Yes | ISO 8601 timestamp |
| `level` | Yes | `debug`, `info`, `warning`, `error` |
| `service` | Yes | Service name (`api`, `firewall`, `secrets`) |
| `event` | Yes | Machine-readable event name |
| `msg` | No | Human-readable message |
| `thread_key` | No | Thread identifier (when applicable) |

> **Never log secret values, auth headers, or raw tokens.**

## Deployment

The deploy box (self-hosted GitHub Actions runner) is accessible via SSH:

```bash
ssh ubuntu@206.223.235.69
```

The canonical checkout lives at `/home/ubuntu/github/<owner>/<repo>` on the box.

All deploys happen automatically via GitHub Actions on merge to `main`.

| Change | Deploy action |
|--------|--------------|
| `tools/**` or `workflows/**` only | Zero-downtime hot-reload (file watcher auto-detects, no restart) |
| `services/api/**` | `docker compose up -d --build api` |
| `services/slackbot/**` | `docker compose up -d --build slackbot` |
| `services/sandbox/**` | `docker compose build sandbox` |
| `docker-compose.yml`, `services/api/Dockerfile` | Rebuild API |

**Tool & workflow hot-reload:** The API watches bind-mounted `tools/` and `workflows/` directories via `watchfiles`. When plugin files change, the API auto-reloads within seconds — no container restart needed.

## E2E Testing (without Slack)

### 1. Bring up the stack

```bash
docker compose up -d postgres api
docker compose build sandbox
```

All E2E curl commands below use `docker exec` for localhost bypass (no API key needed).
To test from outside the container, create a DB-backed key via the [admin API](#api-key-management).

### 2. Spawn a runtime assignment

```bash
THREAD_KEY=test-e2e-1

SPAWN=$(docker exec centaur-api-1 curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/agent/spawn \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"thread_key\":\"${THREAD_KEY}\",\"harness\":\"amp\"}")
ASSIGNMENT_GENERATION=$(printf '%s' "$SPAWN" | jq -r '.assignment_generation')
```

### 3. Persist a message

```bash
docker exec centaur-api-1 curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/agent/message \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"thread_key\":\"${THREAD_KEY}\",\"assignment_generation\":${ASSIGNMENT_GENERATION},\"role\":\"user\",\"parts\":[{\"type\":\"text\",\"text\":\"Reply with exactly PONG and nothing else.\"}]}"
```

### 4. Enqueue execution

```bash
EXECUTE=$(docker exec centaur-api-1 curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/agent/execute \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"thread_key\":\"${THREAD_KEY}\",\"assignment_generation\":${ASSIGNMENT_GENERATION},\"harness\":\"amp\",\"delivery\":{\"platform\":\"dev\"}}")
EXECUTION_ID=$(printf '%s' "$EXECUTE" | jq -r '.execution_id')
```

### 5. Tail durable events (or reconnect later)

```bash
docker exec centaur-api-1 curl -s -N \
  "http://localhost:8000/agent/threads/${THREAD_KEY}/events?execution_id=${EXECUTION_ID}&after_event_id=0"
```

If this stream disconnects, reconnect with the last seen `event_id` as `after_event_id`. If the execution already finished, the endpoint emits the terminal `execution_state` snapshot.

### 6. Inspect or cancel

```bash
docker exec centaur-api-1 curl -s "http://localhost:8000/agent/executions/${EXECUTION_ID}" | jq

docker exec centaur-api-1 curl -s -X POST \
  "http://localhost:8000/agent/executions/${EXECUTION_ID}/cancel" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{}'
```

### 7. Release the assignment when finished

```bash
docker exec centaur-api-1 curl -s -X POST "http://localhost:8000/agent/threads/${THREAD_KEY}/release" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"release_id":"rel-test-e2e-1","cancel_inflight":true}'
```

### Debugging

```bash
docker ps --filter label=centaur-agent=true
docker exec <container_id> curl -s http://api:8000/health
```
