# Policy Gigabrain

Centralized intelligence system for government affairs. Generates meeting briefers, tracks staffers and legislators, monitors legislation, predicts votes, and surfaces portfolio-relevant regulatory actions.

## ⚠️ MANDATORY FIRST STEP: Policy Explainer Index

**Before answering ANY policy or regulatory question — before running web searches or reading external sources — you MUST first check the Paradigm Policy team's internal analysis.**

```bash
call discover gsuite
call gsuite docs_get_text '{"document_id":"1yiKL4NgJfT0cAXehqHvaYC1mMezKdDhxwnr8Gm8aa6c"}'
```

This is the **Policy Explainer Index** ([link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yiKL4NgJfT0cAXehqHvaYC1mMezKdDhxwnr8Gm8aa6c/edit?tab=t.0)), maintained by the Policy team. It contains Paradigm's internal analysis and takes on major regulatory developments (GENIUS Act, FDIC rulemakings, SEC actions, etc.).

**Why this matters:** The Policy team's analysis includes Paradigm-specific context, portfolio impact assessments, and strategic framing that external sources cannot provide. External web searches should only supplement — never replace — the team's own work.

**Workflow:**
1. Read the Policy Explainer Index to check if the topic has been analyzed
2. If an explainer exists, read the linked analysis doc for full detail
3. Only then supplement with external sources (OCC/SEC/CFTC websites, Federal Register, etc.) if needed
4. Always cite the internal analysis as the primary source

## Workflows

### 1. Meeting Briefer Generation

Generate a policy briefing memo before Hill meetings.

**Trigger Phrases** (from Madison, Dominique, Alex G., Justin, Stefan, Katie, or Caitlin):
- "Write a policy briefing memo for [Name, Title]"
- "Briefing memo for [Name]"
- "Policy briefer for [Name]"
- "Meeting brief for [Name]"
- "Prep notes for [Name]"
- "Not the usual memo"
- "Facts and substance"
- "Put this in a Google Doc"

**Input:** Member/staffer name, meeting context, date, and any requested topical sections (for example: crypto knowledge, prediction markets, AI, defense tech, robotics)

**Output Mode Selection:**
- Default to **operator brief mode** for standard requests like "briefing memo," "policy briefer," or "meeting brief."
- Switch to **prep-notes mode** when the user asks for something like "not the usual memo," "facts and substance," "prep notes," or "put this in a Google Doc," or otherwise signals they want dense member/staffer prep rather than a polished memo.
- If the user specifies sections to include or exclude, follow that list literally. Do not add extra sections for symmetry.
- If the user asks for a Google Doc, write in the requested mode first, then do a Docs formatting pass before returning the link.

**Steps:**
1. Read the Policy Explainer Index first, then check Shift / slack / notes for prior Paradigm context and any portfolio-company relevance that sharpens the read.
   ```bash
   call slack search_messages '{"query":"from:#policy [member_name]"}'
   call paradigmdb notes_search '{"query":"[member_name]"}'
   call paradigmdb notes_search '{"query":"[relevant_topic_or_company]"}'
   ```
2. Verify any company example in Shift before mentioning it. Only use Paradigm portfolio companies.
3. Look up member profile via web search (committee assignments, voting history, public statements, current lane)
4. Find relevant pending legislation:
   ```bash
   call congress bills '{"congress":119}'
   call congress bill '{"congress":119,"type":"s","number":123}'
   ```
5. Check FEC for campaign contribution context when it materially helps:
   ```bash
   call openfec candidates '{"name":"[member_name]"}'
   call openfec contributions '{"contributor_name":"[member_name]"}'
   ```
6. Cross-reference with paradigmdb for portfolio company relevance:
   ```bash
   call paradigmdb db_query '{"query":"SELECT * FROM \"Organization\" WHERE name ILIKE '\''%relevant_company%'\'';"}'
   ```
7. Generate the selected output shape below

**Shared Format Rules:**
- Write these as meeting prep deliverables, not formal research memos.
- Use short paragraphs and crisp bullets. Prefer direct sentences over issue-summary prose.
- Do **not** use the old memo scaffolding (`Executive Summary`, `Background`, `Primary Ask / Secondary Objectives / Success Criteria`, `Specific Topics To Address`) unless a policy-team member explicitly asks for it.
- Include only the topical sections the prompt asks for or that clearly earn their place. Common sections include `Crypto Knowledge`, `Stance on Prediction Markets`, `Stance on AI`, `Stance on Defense Tech`, and `Stance on Robotics`.
- Use less interpretive language. Favor "this is the lane" and "this is what they are likely to care about" over broader ideological framing.
- If you mention a portfolio company, it must be a **Paradigm portfolio company verified in Shift**. Use **one company by default**. Mention it only if it materially sharpens the memo.
- Put the company mention in the **second bullet** of the relevant topical section after first establishing the member read.
- Company mentions should focus on the business and the concrete policy lane it makes real. Use public toplines and high-level internal context when helpful, but do not add a separate company sidebar.

**Operator Brief Mode:**
- Use this when the user asks for the usual briefing memo shape.
- Start with the office read, then move into the lanes that matter for the meeting.

**Prep-Notes Mode:**
- Use this when the user wants dense prep notes, a less polished memo, or a Google Doc handoff.
- Lead with factual bullets, not connective tissue. Do not add framing lines like "Below is a memo," "taken together," "more broadly," or "the key takeaway is."
- Keep each bullet loaded with one concrete read, fact, vote signal, committee lane, or policy implication. If a section needs context, put it in another bullet, not a throat-clearing sentence.
- Prefer section labels like `Office Read`, `Biography`, `Goals`, and only the topical lanes the user asked for. If the user only wants selected sections, omit everything else.
- Omit empty sections rather than filling them with generic scene-setting.
- If a section needs a short paragraph, keep it factual and avoid editorial transitions between paragraphs and bullets.
- When the user asks for a Google Doc, the final document must use real Google Docs headings and bulleted lists, not literal `#`, `##`, `-`, or `•` characters left in plain text.

**Prep-Notes Template:**
```
Office Read
• [Direct read on the office and the productive lane]
• [What to avoid or where not to overreach]

Biography
• [Role, committee seat, or prior career fact that changes the read]
• [Any other fact that changes how they process the issue]

Goals
• [Goal 1]
• [Goal 2]

[Optional user-selected topical section]
• [Fact-dense bullet]
• [Optional verified company example in bullet two if it materially sharpens the lane]
• [Fact-dense bullet]
```

**Operator-Brief Template:**
```
Landscape Summary
[2 short paragraphs on why this office matters, what lane is productive, and what frame to avoid.]

Biography
[1-2 short paragraphs on role, committee seats, prior career, and anything that changes how they process the issue.]

Goals
• [Goal 1]
• [Goal 2]
• [Goal 3]

Crypto Knowledge
• [Short, concrete bullet]
• [Optional second bullet with one verified Paradigm company if it materially sharpens the lane]
• [Short, concrete bullet]

Stance on Prediction Markets
• [Short, concrete bullet]
• [Optional company/business example in bullet two if relevant]
• [Short, concrete bullet]

Stance on AI
• [Short, concrete bullet]
• [Optional company/business example in bullet two if relevant]
• [Short, concrete bullet]

Stance on Defense Tech
• [Short, concrete bullet]
• [Optional company/business example in bullet two if relevant]
• [Short, concrete bullet]

Stance on Robotics
• [Short, concrete bullet]
• [Optional company/business example in bullet two if relevant]
• [Short, concrete bullet]
```

**Section Selection Rules:**
- In operator brief mode, `Landscape Summary`, `Biography`, and `Goals` are the default anchor sections.
- In prep-notes mode, default to `Office Read`, `Biography`, and `Goals` unless the user asks for a different subset.
- If the user asks for only one or two sections, provide only those sections plus any minimal orientation needed to make them usable.
- Add topical sections only when the prompt, agenda, or office lane makes them useful.
- Do not force symmetry. A strong memo may have `Crypto Knowledge` and `Stance on Defense Tech` but no AI section, or AI and robotics but no prediction-markets section.
- If a section has nothing useful to say, omit it.

**Google Docs Formatting Checklist:**
1. If the user asked for a document, run `call discover gsuite` before any Docs mutation so you use the live method names.
2. Create or open the Google Doc with `call gsuite docs_create`, `call gsuite docs_get`, and `call gsuite docs_insert` or `call gsuite docs_append` as needed.
3. Run `call gsuite docs_batch_update` to convert section labels into heading styles and body ranges into bulleted lists. Do not stop at pasted plain text.
4. Run `call gsuite docs_get` after the formatting pass and verify the structure is real headings plus bullets, not literal marker characters sitting in body text.
5. If verification fails, fix the document before returning it.

**Company-Reference Example:**
```text
Stance on Defense Tech
• Kennedy should be receptive to defense tech when it is framed around readiness, industrial capacity, and strategic competition, not startup culture.
• True Anomaly is a useful example. It just raised $650 million, is building spacecraft and autonomy software for contested-space missions, and is already tied to Space Force work.
• The strongest pitch is that the U.S. should make room for trusted new defense suppliers that can build strategically important systems at scale without lowering oversight.
```

## Natural Language Queries

The system should answer questions like:

- "What is Senator X's likely position on the GENIUS Act and why?"
- "Which bills introduced this session could affect our stablecoin portfolio companies?"
- "Who are the key staffers on Senate Banking covering crypto?"
- "What have we heard about stablecoin reserve requirements in the last 90 days?"
- "Generate a briefer for my meeting with Rep Y tomorrow"
- "What is the current whip count on [bill]?"
- "Which states have introduced DeFi-related bills this year?"

---

## Example Session

**User:** Policy briefer for Senator Lummis — meeting tomorrow about stablecoin legislation.

**Agent:**
1. Read Policy Explainer Index first for internal analysis
2. Web search for Senator Lummis profile, recent statements, committee assignments
3. Search internal sources:
   ```bash
   call slack search_messages '{"query":"Lummis"}'
   call gsuite gmail_search '{"query":"Lummis"}'
   call paradigmdb notes_search '{"query":"Lummis"}'
   ```
4. Find current stablecoin legislation status
