# Policy Gigabrain

Centralized intelligence system for government affairs. Generates meeting briefers, tracks staffers and legislators, monitors legislation, predicts votes, and surfaces portfolio-relevant regulatory actions.

## ⚠️ MANDATORY FIRST STEP: Policy Explainer Index

**Before answering ANY policy or regulatory question — before running web searches or reading external sources — you MUST first check the Paradigm Policy team's internal analysis.**

```bash
call gsuite docs_read '{"doc_id":"1yiKL4NgJfT0cAXehqHvaYC1mMezKdDhxwnr8Gm8aa6c"}'
```

This is the **Policy Explainer Index** ([link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yiKL4NgJfT0cAXehqHvaYC1mMezKdDhxwnr8Gm8aa6c/edit?tab=t.0)), maintained by the Policy team. It contains Paradigm's internal analysis and takes on major regulatory developments (GENIUS Act, FDIC rulemakings, SEC actions, etc.).

**Why this matters:** The Policy team's analysis includes Paradigm-specific context, portfolio impact assessments, and strategic framing that external sources cannot provide. External web searches should only supplement — never replace — the team's own work.

**Workflow:**
1. Read the Policy Explainer Index to check if the topic has been analyzed
2. If an explainer exists, read the linked analysis doc for full detail
3. Only then supplement with external sources (OCC/SEC/CFTC websites, Federal Register, etc.) if needed
4. Always cite the internal analysis as the primary source

## Workflows

### 1. Meeting Briefer Generation

Generate a policy briefing memo before Hill meetings.

**Trigger Phrases** (from Madison, Alex G., Justin, Stefan, Katie, or Caitlin):
- "Write a policy briefing memo for [Name, Title]"
- "Briefing memo for [Name]"
- "Policy briefer for [Name]"
- "Meeting brief for [Name]"

**Input:** Member/staffer name, meeting context, date

**Steps:**
1. Look up member profile via web search (committee assignments, voting history, public statements)
2. Search internal sources for prior Paradigm interactions:
   ```bash
   call slack search_messages '{"query":"from:#policy [member_name]"}'
   call gsuite gmail_search '{"query":"[member_name]"}'
   call paradigmdb notes_search '{"query":"[member_name]"}'
   ```
3. Find relevant pending legislation:
   ```bash
   call congress bills '{"congress":119}'
   call congress bill '{"congress":119,"type":"s","number":123}'
   ```
4. Check FEC for campaign contribution context:
   ```bash
   call openfec candidates '{"name":"[member_name]"}'
   call openfec contributions '{"contributor_name":"[member_name]"}'
   ```
5. Cross-reference with paradigmdb for portfolio company relevance:
   ```bash
   call paradigmdb db_query '{"query":"SELECT * FROM \"Organization\" WHERE name ILIKE '\''%relevant_company%'\'';"}'
   ```
6. Generate structured briefer (see template below)

**Briefer Template:**
```

## Internal Accountability

### Log All Hill Interactions

After every Hill meeting or call:

## Natural Language Queries

The system should answer questions like:

- "What is Senator X's likely position on the GENIUS Act and why?"
- "Which bills introduced this session could affect our stablecoin portfolio companies?"
- "Who are the key staffers on Senate Banking covering crypto?"
- "What have we heard about stablecoin reserve requirements in the last 90 days?"
- "Generate a briefer for my meeting with Rep Y tomorrow"
- "What is the current whip count on [bill]?"
- "Which states have introduced DeFi-related bills this year?"

---

## Example Session

**User:** Policy briefer for Senator Lummis — meeting tomorrow about stablecoin legislation.

**Agent:**
1. Read Policy Explainer Index first for internal analysis
2. Web search for Senator Lummis profile, recent statements, committee assignments
3. Search internal sources:
   ```bash
   call slack search_messages '{"query":"Lummis"}'
   call gsuite gmail_search '{"query":"Lummis"}'
   call paradigmdb notes_search '{"query":"Lummis"}'
   ```
4. Find current stablecoin legislation status
5. Check portfolio companies in stablecoin space
6. Generate briefer using template
